My name is Kostas, i am coming from Greece and i live in Germany.

My favourite food is  Pita Giros.
Recipe: Grab an authentic Greek chicken gyro pita from a neighbourhood ‘souvlaki shop’ in Greece or… make it yourself at home. No need for a spit! Just cook marinated chicken thigh pieces in your oven. Then wrap in pita bread with ripe tomatoes, tangy onion, crunchy lettuce, refreshing tzatziki sauce and… fries!

Word is the earth with all the beings upon it.
