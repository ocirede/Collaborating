My name is Kostas, I am coming from Greece and I live in Germany.

My favourite food is  Pita Giros.
Recipe: Grab an authentic Greek chicken gyro pita from a neighbourhood ‘souvlaki shop’ in Greece or… make it yourself at home. No need for a spit! Just cook marinated chicken thigh pieces in your oven. Then wrap in pita bread with ripe tomatoes, tangy onion, crunchy lettuce, refreshing tzatziki sauce and… fries!

## Worlanyo Kwabla Kporfeame

I am Worlanyo Kwabla Kporfeame. I'm aspiring to be a web developer.

My favorite dish is rice and stew.

Here is a simple recipe for rice and stew:

Ingredients:
- 1 cup of white rice
- 2 cups of water
- 2 tbsp of oil
- 1 onion, diced
- 2 cloves of garlic, minced
- 1 lb of stewing beef, cubed
- 1 cup of beef broth
- 1 can of diced tomatoes
- 2 carrots, sliced
- 2 potatoes, peeled and cubed
- Salt and pepper to taste

Instructions:

1. Rinse the rice in a fine-mesh strainer under cold water until the water runs clear. Place the rice in a medium pot with 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low, cover, and simmer for 18-20 minutes until the rice is cooked and the water is absorbed.

2. While the rice is cooking, heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 2-3 minutes.

3. Add the beef to the pot and cook until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes.

4. Pour in the beef broth and diced tomatoes, scraping the bottom of the pot to release any browned bits. Bring to a simmer and cook for 10 minutes.

5. Add the sliced carrots and cubed potatoes to the pot and stir to combine. Cover the pot and simmer for 30-40 minutes until the vegetables are tender and the stew has thickened.

6. Season the stew with salt and pepper to taste.

7. Serve the stew over the cooked rice and enjoy!
